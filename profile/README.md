## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Texas Tech Google Developer Student Club!

## Texas Tech Developer Student Club Projects

Projects are meant to be a way for participants and onlookers alike to learn how to build in a low risk environment. The goal at the end of one of our projects is that you'll leave equipped and able to build with the tool we used.

Here you can see all the projects we have going on and each of them will have contribution guidelines so you don't get lost!

## Resources

If you have no idea where to start, here's a lil video too on [how to contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-GXViaI4tI). We hope to see your commits soon!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

 A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
